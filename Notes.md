# Notes

### Inverted Index

 - Inverted index takes a bag of words and returns the documents where those words were found in.
     - A blind inverted index returns around 10 million documents.
         - Pros
             - Completely exhaustive of the dataset.
             - Simple to implement with good compression (data storage) via the trie structure.
         - Cons
             - Returns too many documents. Use of set union results in most of the original corpus being returned for words that are common but not stop words.
     - A few strategies have been devised to reduce the number of documents returned by the inverted index.
         - Weighted documents based on Inverse Document Frequency
             - For each document that is returned, the value associated with that document corresponds to the sum of all IDF values for the terms that returned the document. Documents with a weight above a certain threshold are included.
             - Pros
                 - Simple to implement with good compression (data storage) via the trie structure.
                 - Eliminates a lot of documents (depending on the threshold).
             - Cons
                 - Not as exhaustive as the blind inverted index. May skip some relevant documents.
                 - Threshold requires finetuning via trial & error.
         - Ignore query words with low Inverse Document Frequency
             - Words with an IDF below a certain threshold are excluded from the blind inverted index.
             - Pros
                 - Simple to implement with good compression (data storage) via the trie structure.
                 - Eliminates a lot of common words which in turn eliminates a lot of documents (depending on the threshold).
             - Cons
                 - Not as exhaustive as the blind inverted index. May skip some relevant documents.
                 - Threshold requires finetuning via trial & error.
         - Category traversal with weighted TF-IDF
             - Traverse the category graph based on the TF-IDF of the query and the words associated with the category.
                 - "A method for automated document classification using Wikipedia-derived weighted keywords" [Whitepaper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283227199_A_method_for_automated_document_classification_using_Wikipedia-derived_weighted_keywords) ([local copy](./Whitepapers/ICoDSE2014-AuthorCopy.pdf))
             - Pros
                 - More abstract but also more direct/faster than plain inverted index.
             - Cons
                 - More storage usage than blind inverted index. Lots of redundant/overlapping mappings between each node in the category tree.
                 - Compute heavy. Requires computing a TF-IDF at runtime for each level in the tree structure.
         - Category traversal with Word2Vec similarity
             - Pros
                 - More abstract but also more direct/faster than plain inverted index.
             - Cons
                 - Heavy reliance on third party structures/packages.
                     - Requires word2vec model
                         - May or may not be supported for other languages (thus locking this part of the code to python).
                         - Model is pretrained on some other dataset. May be a good idea to look at a model trained on wikipedia or train it myself.
                     - Wikicat repo below for simplified creation/structuring of the categories.
                         - Is a python-only repo/package.
                     - Doesn't handle multi word labels (can only convert one word at a time to vector).
         - Category traversal with BERT similarity
             - Pros
                 - More abstract but also more direct/faster than plain inverted index.
             - Cons
                 - Compute intensive
                     - Every query will have to be embedded (cost is a few seconds but that is per query).
                     - Will have to precompute vectors for categories and store that information.
                         - Takes time depending on the hardware where this is being deployed.
                         - Incurs storage cost too.
                     - Have to recompute every time the embedding model is switched.
         - Document vectors with Doc2Vec
             - Pros
                 - Compresses documents to small vectors.
             - Cons
                 - Compute intensive
                     - Will take a while to build and train model.
                     - Will have to precompute vectors for categories and store that information.
                         - Takes time depending on the hardware where this is being deployed.
                         - Incurs storage cost too.
                 - Scaling
                     - Will have to scale to all documents (roughly 26 to 40 million). That will incur a lot of time when computing similarity and ranking. No better than the results that were being returned from the blind inverted index (possibly worse).
         - Directy category mapping with BERT similarity
             - Similar to "Category traversal with BERT similarity" except no category tree is involved.
             - Pros:
                 - No category tree means more direct access to end categories.
                 - Let's the vector DB do all the work in one shot.
             - Cons:
                 - Does not work with raw text queries like "What color are sapphires?".
